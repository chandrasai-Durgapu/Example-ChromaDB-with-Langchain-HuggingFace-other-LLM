# Example ChromaDB + LangChain + HuggingFace / Other LLMs ðŸŽ¯

This repository demonstrates how to integrate **ChromaDB** (vector database) with **LangChain**, **HuggingFace models**, or other LLMs, by walking through a working example in a Jupyter Notebook.

The notebook `Copy_of_chromadb1_CLEAN.ipynb` serves as the core of the example, showing ingestion of documents, embedding, retrieval, and question answering pipelines.
